/**
 * Handles pooling of connections to <a href="http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/">Rserve</a> instances.
 * Operations are based on the ObjectPool interface as defined in the
 * <a href="http://commons.apache.org/pool/">commons pool</a> package however, this class does
 * not implement the interface because the commons pool package does not support JDK 1.5+
 * features at the time this class was written.
 * <p>
 * Rserve processes available to the pool are configured using a fairly simply xml file.  The
 * root element is called {@code RConnectionPool} and the child nodes are called {@code RServer}.
 * There should be one {@code Rserver} node per Rserve process you wish to be made available in
 * the pool.  Each Rserve node has the following attributes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>host - The host/ip Rserve is running on (required)
 * <li>port - The TCP port Rserve is listening on (default = 6311)
 * <li>username - Username to supply for the connection
 * <li>password - Password to supply for the connection
 * </ul>
 * The following configuration would make three servers available to the pool.
 * <p><em><blockquote><pre>
 * &lt;!-- Configuration file for the connection pool to Rserve processes --&gt;
 * &lt;RConnectionPool&gt;
 *    &lt;!-- default Rserve process running on localhost --&gt;
 *    &lt;RServer host="localhost"/&gt;
 *
 *    &lt;!-- Rserve process on localhost port 6312 --&gt;
 *    &lt;RServer host="127.0.0.1" port="6312"/&gt;
 *
 *    &lt;!-- Rserve process on foobar.med.cornell.edu port 1234 with authentication --&gt;
 *    &lt;RServer host="foobar.med.cornell.edu" port="1234" username="me" password="mypassword"/&gt;
 * &lt;/RConnectionPool&gt;
 * </pre></blockquote></em>
 *
 * <p>
 * The preferred way to specify the configuration file is through the use of a
 * system property called {@code RConnectionPool.configuration}. The property should be a valid url
 * or the name of a resource file that exists on the classpath.  In case the system property
 * {@code RConnectionPool.configuration} is not defined, then the resource will be set to its
 * default value of {@code RConnectionPool.xml}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The connection pool is implemented using the
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">Singleton pattern</a>.
 * Instances of the pool are not created by calling the constructor, but are retrieved using the
 * static method {@link #getInstance()}.  Connections are retrieved from the pool using either
 * {@link #borrowConnection()} or {@link #borrowConnection(long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)}.
 * Both versions will return a valid {@link org.rosuda.REngine.Rserve.RConnection} immediately
 * if one is available.  The borrow method with no parameters will block if there are no
 * connections available, while the latter form will wait until the timeout expires before
 * returning {@code null}.  Connections borrowed from the pool should <strong>NOT</strong>
 * be closed but should be returned to the pool which will handle closing the connections.
